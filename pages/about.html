   <p class="aboutText"><b>
    Newcastle United Football Club is an English professional football club based in Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, that plays in the Premier League, 
    the top flight of English football. Founded in 1892 by the merger of Newcastle East End and Newcastle West End. The team plays its home matches at 
    St. James' Park. Per the Taylor Report's requirement that all Premier League clubs have an all-seater stadium, the ground was adjusted in the mid-1990s 
    and now has a capacity of 52,305. The club has been a member of the Premier League for all but three years of the competition's history, spending 88 
    seasons in the top flight as of July 2020, and have never dropped below English football's second tier since joining the Football League in 1893. Newcastle 
    have won 4 League titles, 6 FA Cups and a Charity Shield, as well as the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup, the ninth highest 
    total of trophies won by an English club. The club's most successful period was between 1904 and 1910, when they won an FA Cup and three of their League 
    titles. Newcastle were relegated in 2009, and again in 2016. The club won promotion at the first time of asking each time, returning to the Premier League, 
    as Championship winners, in 2010 and 2017. Newcastle have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Sunderland, with whom they have contested the Tyne–Wear 
    derby since 1898. The club's traditional kit colours are black and white striped shirts, black shorts and black socks. Their crest has elements of the 
    city coat of arms, which features two grey seahorses. Before each home game, the team enters the field to "Local Hero", and "Blaydon Races" is also sung 
    during games. The club has been owned by Mike Ashley since 2007, succeeding long-term chairman Sir John Hall. The club is the 17th-highest revenue producing 
    club in the world in terms of annual revenue, generating €169.3 million in 2015. Newcastle's highest placing was in 1999, when they were the fifth-highest revenue 
    producing football club in the world, and second in England only behind Manchester United.
