        <b>Newcastle United have confirmed they have launched legal proceedings against the Premier League following a failed takeover bid in the summer.
        The club claim the Premier League broke a confidentiality clause when it "leaked the contents" of a letter about the proceedings to a supporter group.
        A Saudi Arabian-backed consortium pulled out of a Â£300m deal in June.
        They rejected the offer from the Premier League (EPL) of arbitration to determine who would own the club.</b>
